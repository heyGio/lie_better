Original prompt: Build and iterate a playable web game in this workspace, validating changes with a Playwright loop. Generate a markdown file containing detailed requirements for an AI-powered game with LLM NPC + ElevenLabs voice + speech emotion recognition, following the style of missile-command.md and reusing /Users/martin/lie_better architecture.

## 2026-02-28 - Work Log

- Confirmed active codebase is `/Users/martin/lie_better` (current cwd `/Users/martin/Lie Better` was empty).
- Read and applied `develop-web-game` skill instructions.
- Pulled reference style from `missile-command.md` (GitHub raw).
- Audited existing architecture: Next.js app, `/api/transcribe`, `/api/evaluate`, `/api/tts`, plus `lib/mistral.ts`, `lib/huggingface.ts`, `lib/elevenlabs.ts`.
- Created `docs/ai-npc-voice-heist-requirements.md` with detailed implementation requirements and acceptance criteria aligned to existing project.

## Notes

- Spec explicitly reuses current architecture and API contracts instead of proposing a rewrite.
- Included mandatory emotion label set and level-1 easy path (angry strategy vs mafia boss).
- Included explicit logging + Slack alert style requirements (emoji + user-friendly formatting).
- Included Playwright loop requirements for the implementation agent.

## TODO for Next Agent

- Implement config-driven NPC level system to reduce hardcoded branching.
- Add Slack alerting endpoint/integration for production incidents.
- Add deterministic `window.render_game_to_text` and `window.advanceTime` hooks if automated gameplay validation is needed at runtime.
- Run Playwright action-loop validation and archive screenshots/state artifacts.

## 2026-02-28 - Build Iteration 1 (Implementation)

- Added typed fallback gameplay path to remain playable without microphone.
- Added quick strategy controls + hotkeys:
  - `A` = aggressive preset line
  - `B` = calm/affection preset line
  - `Enter` = auto-defuse when code is revealed
- Added stable selectors for automation (`#start-btn`, level control buttons, quick line buttons).
- Added Playwright-facing hooks in UI:
  - `window.render_game_to_text()`
  - `window.advanceTime(ms)`
- Added Slack alert utility (`lib/slack-alert.ts`) with dedupe window.
- Integrated Slack alerts in failure paths:
  - `/api/transcribe`
  - `/api/tts` (GET stream + POST fallback)
  - `/api/evaluate` (model failure + JSON parse fallback)
- Refactored evaluate route toward config-driven level rules via `LEVEL_RULES` (context + emotion shifts + thresholds).

- Installed Playwright local dependency and Chromium browser for deterministic action-loop testing.
- Executed Playwright loops and reviewed screenshots + text-state outputs:
  - Level 1 win path validated (`A` pressure + `Enter` auto-defuse).
  - Level 1 lose path validated (forfeit control / ArrowDown).
  - Level 2 win path validated (direct Level 2 start + calm pet line + auto-defuse).
- Added testability UX controls to support deterministic automation without microphone:
  - quick strategy buttons
  - forfeit control
  - direct Level 2 start from idle
- Updated level-2 semantic patterns to accept plural pet words (`pats`, `cuddles`) so intent parsing is robust.

## Validation Artifacts

- `output/web-game/level1-win-4/`
- `output/web-game/level1-force-lose/`
- `output/web-game/level2-win-2/`

## Remaining Suggestions

- Optional: move quick-test controls behind a `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_CONTROLS=1` flag if you want a cleaner production UI.
- Optional: add a dedicated `/api/slack-test` route to verify webhook formatting from UI.
- Optional: fix Node ESM warning for Playwright client by setting `"type": "module"` or renaming script to `.mjs`.
- Updated README demo flow + optional env vars for Slack alerting and no-mic controls.

## 2026-02-28 - User Fix Pass

- Removed Slack alerting integration from API error paths:
  - deleted `lib/slack-alert.ts`
  - removed alert imports/calls from `/api/evaluate`, `/api/transcribe`, `/api/tts`
  - removed Slack vars from `.env.example` and README
- Fixed phone panel bottom visibility issues:
  - enabled vertical scrolling in phone content container
  - relaxed page overflow behavior (`overflow-y: auto`)
  - reduced phone content density (`gap` + webcam aspect ratio + smaller conversation min-height on small screens)
- Validated with lint/build and visual captures at desktop + mobile-like viewport.

## 2026-02-28 - Emotion Pipeline Fix

- Root cause found: local `.env` had no Hugging Face token variable (`HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` / aliases), so `/api/transcribe` always fell back to transcript heuristic.
- Extended Hugging Face token env alias support in `lib/huggingface.ts`:
  - `HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN`, `HF_API_KEY`, `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN`, `HUGGINGFACE`
- Improved `/api/transcribe` response observability:
  - now returns `emotionModel`, `emotionSource`, `emotionError`
  - logs structured warning with `emotionError` when HF emotion analysis fails
- Updated front-end (`app/page.tsx`) to:
  - parse new emotion diagnostics fields
  - stop silent transcript fallback when HF errors are explicit
  - show user-friendly mic error for HF config/token issues
  - log source/model/error in emotion trace for easy debugging
- Updated README env docs with supported HF token aliases.
- Validation: `npm run lint` and `npm run build` both pass.

## 2026-02-28 - HF Router Migration Fix

- Fixed Hugging Face endpoint migration in `lib/huggingface.ts`:
  - default URL now uses `https://router.huggingface.co/hf-inference/models/<model>`
  - auto-rewrites legacy `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/...` URLs if still configured
- Added explicit error handling for:
  - retired endpoint/deprecation responses (`410`, "no longer supported")
  - model not deployed by inference providers (clear action: deploy dedicated Inference Endpoint + set `HF_EMOTION_API_URL`)
- Updated env docs:
  - `.env.example` now includes `HF_EMOTION_API_URL=`
  - README documents optional dedicated endpoint override
- Added clearer router-task/model unsupported error mapping (actionable message points to dedicated HF Inference Endpoint).
- Validation: `npm run lint` and `npm run build` both pass after migration patch.

## 2026-02-28 - HF 404 Clarification

- Added explicit 404 mapping in `lib/huggingface.ts` for router model-not-found cases:
  - now returns actionable error instructing to deploy dedicated Inference Endpoint and set `HF_EMOTION_API_URL`.
- Verified lint still passes.

## 2026-02-28 - Model Switch (User Requested)

- Switched default speech emotion model to:
  - `firdhokk/speech-emotion-recognition-with-openai-whisper-large-v3`
- Improved env robustness:
  - `HF_EMOTION_MODEL` now accepts either repo id (`owner/repo`) or full Hugging Face model URL.
  - if `HF_EMOTION_API_URL` is mistakenly set to a Hugging Face model page URL, it is converted to router inference URL automatically.
- Expanded emotion label normalization for this model's labels:
  - `fearful -> fear`, `surprised -> surprise`, plus `happiness/sadness` aliases.
- Updated docs:
  - `.env.example` and README now point to the requested model by default.
  - README notes this model may require dedicated `HF_EMOTION_API_URL` because public providers may return 404.
- Validation: `npm run lint` and `npm run build` both pass.

## 2026-03-01 - Level 1 Emotion Tutorial Refactor

- Refactored level-1 progression from 5 stages to 4 strict tutorial stages in `app/api/evaluate/route.ts`.
- New level-1 flow:
  - stage 1: any opening line moves forward
  - stage 2: requires detected `fear`
  - stage 3: requires detected `angry`
  - stage 4: requires detected `angry` again to reveal code
- Removed old stage-5 dependency and updated all prompt/rule references (`FINAL_STAGE=4`, strict-stage rule text, level1Flow payload).
- Rewrote stage hints/guidance patterns to align with the emotion-training tutorial wording.
- Added explicit tutorial success logging with emoji:
  - `✅  [Level1 Tutorial] Stage cleared`
- Updated UI stage cap in `app/page.tsx`:
  - added `LEVEL1_FINAL_STAGE = 4`
  - clamped `nextStage` with the new max
  - changed status text and HUD from `/5` to `/4`

## 2026-03-01 - Validation

- `npm run lint` ✅
- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅
- Playwright action-loop validation skipped in this environment (project is run on external VMs; no local gameplay runtime expected here).
- `npm run build` ❌ (environment/workspace issue unrelated to this change):
  - Next.js lockfile patch step failed (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'os')`)
  - build then failed during page data collection (`Cannot find module for page: /api/evaluate`)

## 2026-03-01 - Bomb Tick SFX (User Requested)

- Added bomb countdown tick sound in `app/page.tsx`, triggered once per second while the timer is actively counting down.
- Added `BOMB_TICK_VOLUME = 0.3` and wired the synthesized tick envelope peak to that exact volume target.
- Added `previousTimerValueRef` and a dedicated effect that plays the tick only when `timeRemaining` decreases (prevents extra ticks on non-countdown renders).
- Reset timer-tracking ref on `startGameSequence` so restart flows begin cleanly.
- Logging on playback failure is user-friendly and emoji-formatted:
  - `⚠️  [Bomb] Tick sound failed`

## 2026-03-01 - Validation (Bomb Tick)

- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅
- `npx eslint app/page.tsx` ❌ (pre-existing, unrelated to this patch):
  - `'INTRO_PROMPT' is assigned a value but never used`
  - `'lastEmotionScore' is assigned a value but never used`
- Playwright action-loop validation skipped in this environment (project runs on external VMs; no local gameplay runtime expected here).

## 2026-03-01 - Level 2 Asset Wiring (User Requested)

- Switched level-2 base background to `public/assets/background_2.png` (replaced previous `shibuya` usage in normal scene and post-failure background state).
- Rewired level-2 NPC sprite selection in `app/page.tsx`:
  - default: `public/assets/NPC2.png`
  - player recognized emotion `angry`: `public/assets/NPC2angry.png`
  - player recognized emotion `fear`: `public/assets/NPC2scared.png`
  - level-2 win state (`won`): `public/assets/NPC2win.png`
- Kept level-1 NPC/background behavior unchanged.

## 2026-03-01 - Validation (Level 2 Assets)

- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅
- `npx eslint app/page.tsx` ❌ (pre-existing, unrelated to this patch):
  - `'INTRO_PROMPT' is assigned a value but never used`
  - `'lastEmotionScore' is assigned a value but never used`
- Playwright action-loop validation skipped in this environment (project runs on external VMs; no local gameplay runtime expected here).

## 2026-03-01 - Mochi Voice Text Update

- Replaced Mochi verbal marker from `Mrrp` to `Miao` across runtime game text:
  - `app/page.tsx` level-2 opening line
  - `app/api/evaluate/route.ts` level-2 fallback and stage feedback lines
- Confirmed no remaining `Mrrp`/`mrrp` in `app/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `services/`.

## 2026-03-01 - Validation (Mochi Text)

- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅

## 2026-03-01 - Level 2 BGM Track Switch (User Requested)

- Updated BGM routing in `app/page.tsx` to use level-specific tracks:
  - intro + level 1: `/assets/Concrete_Empire_2026-02-28T212713.mp3`
  - level 2: `/assets/Phantom_Yamanote.mp3`
- Added constants for both tracks (`LEVEL1_BGM_SRC`, `LEVEL2_BGM_SRC`) and switched audio source dynamically when level changes.
- Kept existing autoplay retry behavior (click/keydown interaction listeners) and added emoji-formatted warning logs when browser blocks playback.
- Added explicit track-switch log:
  - `🎵  [BGM] Track switched`

## 2026-03-01 - Validation (Level 2 BGM)

- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅
- Playwright action-loop validation skipped in this environment (project runs on external VMs; no local gameplay runtime expected here).

## 2026-03-01 - Level 2 Caller Name UI (User Requested)

- Updated dialog caller label in `app/page.tsx` to be level-aware:
  - level 1: `Unknown Caller`
  - level 2: `Mochi`
- Replaced the hardcoded intro status line `Unknown Caller is speaking...` with dynamic caller naming based on selected level at sequence start.
- Result: level-2 dialog box now consistently shows `Mochi` as NPC name.

## 2026-03-01 - Validation (Level 2 Caller Name)

- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅
- Playwright action-loop validation skipped in this environment (project runs on external VMs; no local gameplay runtime expected here).
